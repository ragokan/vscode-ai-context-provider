# VSCode AI Context Provider

A Visual Studio Code extension that helps you copy code with AI-friendly context, including file paths and line numbers. Perfect for when you need to share code snippets with AI assistants like ChatGPT, Claude, or Copilot.

## Features

âœ¨ **Copy as AI Context**: Copies your selected code (or entire file) with contextual information that AI assistants love:
- File path relative to your workspace
- Line number ranges
- Clean, formatted code
- **Automatic markdown syntax highlighting** based on file extension
- Supports 40+ programming languages and file types

### Example Output
```
src/components/Button.tsx:15-25
```tsx
export const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({ 
  children, 
  variant = 'primary', 
  onClick 
}) => {
  return (
    <button 
      className={`btn btn-${variant}`}
      onClick={onClick}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
};
```
```

## Usage

### Method 1: Keyboard Shortcuts
- **macOS**: `Cmd+Shift+C`
- **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl+Shift+C`

### Method 2: Context Menu
1. Select the code you want to copy
2. Right-click to open the context menu
